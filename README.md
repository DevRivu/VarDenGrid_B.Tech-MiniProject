# VarDenGrid_B.Tech-MiniProject
Among all clustering methods, the density-based clustering algorithm is one of the most powerful methods for discovering arbitrary-shaped clusters. However, almost all the renowned density-based algorithm requires user input(s), which are sometimes difficult to determine. Additionally, some of them like DBSCAN are unable to get variable density clusters. We introduce a new algorithm VarDenGrid in the paradigm of density-based clustering that will not require any user input(s) and also will be able to obtain variable density clusters. VarDenGrid starts with grid-based initialization of prospective clusters. Then the initial clusters are modified based on a novel density-based clustering algorithm proposed here. Each prospective cluster determines its density (Epsilon) by the maximum of the nearest neighbor distance of the objects in the cluster.
